# Project Overview

Tools for customizing [semantic release's default plugins](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/plugins#plugins) related to commit messages. By default semantic release uses Angular's commit conventions during the analyzeCommits and generateNotes plugins. This tool allows users to write a configuration object to overwrite the default rules and provides functions to add the configuration support to the existing semantic release plugins.

## Getting started

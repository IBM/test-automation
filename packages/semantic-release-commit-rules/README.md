# Project Overview

Tools for customizing [semantic release's default plugins](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/usage/plugins#plugins) related to commit messages. By default semantic release uses Angular's commit conventions. This tool allows users to integrate a non-standard rules configuration which replaces the default commit message rules during the  _Analyze commits_ and _Generate notes_ [release steps](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/#release-steps).

## Getting started
